# Overview

---

I made this webpage pulling information from an existing API for Final Fantasy characters.

# Description

---

A simple webpage that allows you to scroll through all the characters from all Final Fantasy games. You can press the arrows to nagivate left or right depending on the arrow. You can also use the random button in the middle to pick a random character. The slides loop around back to the beginning or end, infinitely depending on which way you are going. The information is printed to the right, the image of the character is placed in the middle and the description of the character will be on the left.

# Thoughts and Approach

---

I created 3 different divs and then passed in information of a Final Fantasy character. For spacing and visual reasons, I chose to break it down into 3 so it is easier to read. Using the original concept from my first version of this website with only JS, HTML and CSS, I was able to transfer it over using React.

# Future Goals

---

1. I plan to further style and change the way the website looks as I gain more practice and skill into CSS. There are also other APIs that I can add to the website, such as the Monsters API and the Items API.

# Technologies Used

---

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. JavaScript
4. React
